<h2> Challange</h2>
<p> For this lab we were tasked with creating multiple div ids with the tags:floated, center-horiz, center-img, and center-both.
	 We also had to link back to our home index and the CSS file for this page. All images had to be around 100 to 150 px wide.
	 Divs had to be 30% wide. The center-horz centered the text, center-img centered the img horizontally, and center-both centers the image both vertically and horizontally.
</p>
<h2> Problems</h2>
<p> The biggest problem was a result of copying my code for this lab from a previous lab.
	 	In the old code there were lines of code that interfered with what i needed to do for this lab.
 		When I went back to delete the extra code it just messed up the page further. This led me to scrap all of the code and start from scratch for this lab.
	 	My partner helped with supplying the base code I needed for the lab and I found the rest by watching Wednesday's lecture over again.</p>
