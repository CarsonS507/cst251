		  <h2>Subject</h2>
				<p> In this lab we were tasked with changing the margins,
					color of the body content, and adding a border to our html with a CSS file.
					For the bonus task we had to reformat our home index with a CSS file.
			<h3>Difficulties</h3>
				<p> We didn't really encounter any difficulties with this lab. Most of the work was carried over from previous labs.
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>This lab and my home page now have matching appearances due to them sharing the same CSS.</p>
