		  <h2>Subject</h2>
				<p> This lab continues to build off of us working with CSS with an emphasis on styling text.
					Using a linked CSS we were tasked with changing the font, color, text transform and letter spacing of our body.
			<h3>Difficulties</h3>
				<p> This lab didn't cause us any issues since we had already changed the style of our text in previous labs.
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p> For this lab I changed the font to the hated Comic Sans font.
					 I also made use of the hexidecimal color system to color the font of the body paragraphs.</p>
