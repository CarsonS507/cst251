		<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>The goal of this lab was to expand the local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>At first glance this lab seemed like it would be complicated but after starting to work on the code I felt more confident about it.
			The hardest part about Lab 3 for me was actually starting the assignment. When I opened Atom to begin coding I accidentally closed the tab displaying all of my files. While I was trying to get the file tab to reappear I accidentally closed out of the tool bar for Atom. Without the tool bar I wasn't able to open any files or save. I eventually fixed the solution by closing Atom and reopening it. Once opened there was a pop up menu that allowed me to reopen my file tree. I then figured out how to save my progress with key board commands.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>This index.html was the result of lab 3 along with the links to each lab that can be found on my home index.</p>
