					Random Facts about me: I love to draw, I prefer Xbox over Playstation, I think the Clone Wars was the peak of Star Wars content,
					I am currently working a set of mandalorian armor, and I have no belly button.

		  <h2>Big Idea</h2>
				<p> For this lab we had to attach a sidebar to our HTML using CSS. We then had to style the sidebar with the CSS.
					We also had to style our links div so it "stuck" to the top of the page when you scroll down.


			<h3>Difficulties</h3>
				<p>Our biggest difficulty was getting the sidebar to appear and stick.
					 We looked at the notes from class and even sent a request for help on slack but came up empty.
				 After taking a break we came back to the lab and searched online and tested out examples we found online.</p>


				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The lab was hard but we eventually got the sidebar to appear and stick as it was required.</p>
