				<h2>Subject</h2>
				<p> In this lab we were tasked with continuing to explore CSS selectors.
					We had to style every element of a class, give particular elements class names, style more than one element at a time, and style and element with another element.
					We also had to style an image, so it would change size whenever you hover over it.
				<h3>Difficulties</h3>
				<p> For difficulties I had trouble getting the CSS to format an image. With the help of my partner I got it to work.
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The current appearance of the CSS was caused during experimentation with the CSS code to try and get the image to resize while hovering over it.</p>
